# Project Guidelines

## Environment & Tooling
- **Package Manager:** pnpm
- **Type Checking:** tsc --noEmit (never tsc alone)
- **Linting:** eslint <path> [--fix]
- **Build:** Only when explicitly requested

## Style & Conventions
- TypeScript strict mode, functional components, explicit types (no any)
- After edits: eslint --fix <file> && tsc --noEmit

## Core Principles
- Verify over assume
- Failures first (lead with errors)
- Always re-raise (never swallow exceptions)
- DO NOT OVERCOMPLICATE
- DO NOT OVERSIMPLIFY

## Critical Rules
- NEVER amend commits unless user says 'amend commit'
- NEVER commit files in gitignored directories unless explicitly requested - DO NOT use git add -f to bypass .gitignore
- Minimal changes; avoid ambiguity; no placeholders
- Keep prompts concise; log costs
- EFFICIENCY in application performance and user experience - REFLECT this in EVERY implementation

## /spec Workflow
Reference agents/spec/{STAGE}.md for detailed instructions.
- Default path: specs/<YYYY>/<MM>/<branch>/<NNN>-<title>.md
- Modify AI Section only; never touch Human Section
- Commit after each stage: spec(<NNN>): <STAGE> - <title>

## Path Resolution

**Project root** = `$PWD` (where Claude is launched, `.agentic-config.json` stored)
**Global installation** = `$AGENTIC_CONFIG_PATH` or `~/.agents/agentic-config` (where `core/`, `VERSION` exist)

**CRITICAL**: `core/` does NOT exist at project root. Only specific command files are symlinked.

To source global libs (spec-resolver.sh, etc.):
```bash
# Pure bash (no external commands like cat) for restricted shell compatibility
_agp=""
[[ -f ~/.agents/.path ]] && _agp=$(<~/.agents/.path)
AGENTIC_GLOBAL="${AGENTIC_CONFIG_PATH:-${_agp:-$HOME/.agents/agentic-config}}"
unset _agp
source "$AGENTIC_GLOBAL/core/lib/spec-resolver.sh"
```

## Git Workflow
- Base branch: main (not master)
- git status returns CWD-relative paths - use those exact paths with git add
- Never commit to main; never amend unless 'amend commit' explicitly requested
- One stage = one commit: spec(<NNN>): <STAGE> - <title>


## CHANGELOG Guidelines
- CHANGELOG entries are written **only against origin/main**
- Fixes within the same branch/unreleased work are NOT separate entries
- From main's linear history perspective, unreleased changes are ONE logical unit
- Do NOT add "Fixed" entries for implementation iterations before merge to main

## Conditional Documentation

Read documentation only when relevant to your task:

- **`$AGENTIC_GLOBAL/docs/external-specs-storage.md`** - When:
  - Configuring external specs repository
  - Working with `/spec`, `/o_spec`, `/po_spec`, or `/branch` commands
  - Modifying spec path resolution or commit routing

## Project-Specific Instructions
READ @PROJECT_AGENTS.md for project-specific instructions - CRITICAL COMPLIANCE
